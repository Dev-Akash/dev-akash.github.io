          <h2>Getting Started with Videos in OpenCV</h2>
          <p>Hi there, and welcome again to Dev-akash's blog post, so today we will be getting started with videos in
               OpenCV, and will be learning about the following things: <br>
          <ul>
               <li>Capturing Video using Web Camera</li>
               <li>Reading Video from a file</li>
          </ul>
          After going through the blog you will be able to read a video from a file and capture the live feed from your
          own camera and yes with this you can also read multiple cameras at same time (Bonus!).<br>
          So let's get Started!!<br><br>
          <div class="ads">
               <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
               <!-- first_add -->
               <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8197254535741426"
                    data-ad-slot="6773757685" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
               <script>
                    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
               </script>
          </div>
          </p>
          <h3>Capturing Video using Web Camera</h3>
          <p>Capturing a video from a web camera is a very basic requirement for most of the tasks in Computer Vision
               field such as Realtime Attendance marking system, Pose estimation and Recognition, Pedestrain Detection,
               etc which requires the live feed from the cameras and now you would be able to do that too. So first have
               a look at the code and then we will dive into it to understand it more clearly.</p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Dev-Akash/ac68e7f2260fb2e6e8d8a750c256c961.js"></script>
          So, lets dive into the code <br><br>
          In line 2 and 3 we are importing the importing libraries, namely OpenCV and Numpy as we will use them.
          <br><br>
          In line 6 we are calling a function of opencv as <strong>cv2.VideoCapute()</strong> which is actually
          accessing the camera attached to your computer and passing the data captured from it to the variable
          <strong>cam</strong>, the argument passed in the paranthesis as <strong>0</strong> states that we are using
          the default camera or the first camera if multiple cameras are connected and if you want to switch to another
          camera then default, just change the argument 0 to 1, 2, 3... etc as per number of cameras connected.
          <br><br>
          From line 10-19 we are running a loop to read the frames coming from camera and showing it to a window created
          by OpenCV. So in the loop in line 12 we take <strong>ret, frame</strong> after reading the input from the cam
          as <strong>cam.read()</strong>, where ret is the status of the captured frame and <strong>frame</strong> is
          the image.
          <br><br>
          In line 15, we are showing our captured image in <strong>frame</strong> variable in a window named
          <strong>"Webcam"</strong> using the opencv function <strong>cv2.imshow()</strong>
          <br><br>
          In line 18-19, we are creating a condition that when a user presses the <strong>q</strong> button on keybord
          the loop breaks and executes the upcoming lines
          <br><br>
          <div class="ads">
               <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
               <!-- first_add -->
               <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8197254535741426"
                    data-ad-slot="6773757685" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
               <script>
                    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
               </script>
          </div>
          In line 22 and 24, we just close the opened camera and also close all the windows created by opencv during the
          execution of program.
          <h3>Reading Video from a file</h3>

          Reading a video from a file is not a much different task as what we have to do is to change the source of feed
          provided, that is, in the previous section our source of input was camera and hence we were giving argument as
          a number <strong>0</strong> to access the default camera and now to access a file on the system as feed we
          will provide the path of the file as argument to the function.<br>
          Here is the code, check it out. And just to remind after this we have a <strong>bonus</strong>.<br><br>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Dev-Akash/ae852fe6705d07ca6cb4ce385a73e82b.js"></script>

          <h3>Bonus</h3>
          <p>So as stated above i am going to show you how you can read mutiple cameras simulatneously and I know after
               reading this much of blog you would be having a idea how to do it. But to make you comfortable with it I
               am just going to provide the code here and I promise there is nothing new to explain here, infact you
               will explain what is happening to yourself (Its a great excercise !!).<br><br>
               And Thanks for your love and support by reading this blog !!<br>
