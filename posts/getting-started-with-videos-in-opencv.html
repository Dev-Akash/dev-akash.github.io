        <span class="fs-1" style="font-weight: 100;">Getting Started with Videos in OpenCV</span>
        <p class="d-block mt-3" style="font-weight: 100;">Hi there, and welcome again to Dev-akash's blog post, so today
            we will be getting started with videos in OpenCV, and will be learning about the following things:
        </p>
        <ul style="font-weight: 100;">
            <li>Capturing Video using Web Camera</li>
            <li>Reading Video from a file</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: 100;">
            After going through the blog you will be able to read a video from a file and capture the live feed from
            your own camera and yes with this you can also read multiple cameras at same time (Bonus!).
            So let's get Started!!
        </p>

        <span class="d-block fs-3" style="font-weight: 100;">Capturing Video using Web Camera</span>
        <p style="font-weight: 100;">Capturing a video from a web camera is a very basic requirement for most of the
            tasks in Computer Vision field such as Realtime Attendance marking system, Pose estimation and Recognition,
            Pedestrain Detection, etc which requires the live feed from the cameras and now you would be able to do that
            too. So first have a look at the code and then we will dive into it to understand it more clearly.</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/Dev-Akash/ac68e7f2260fb2e6e8d8a750c256c961.js"></script>
        <p style="font-weight: 100;">
            So, lets dive into the code <br><br>
            In line 2 and 3 we are importing the importing libraries, namely OpenCV and Numpy as
            we will use them.
            <br><br>
            In line 6 we are calling a function of opencv as cv2.VideoCapute() which is actually
            accessing the camera attached to your computer and passing the data captured from it
            to the variable
            cam, the argument passed in the paranthesis as 0 states that we are using
            the default camera or the first camera if multiple cameras are connected and if you
            want to switch to another
            camera then default, just change the argument 0 to 1, 2, 3... etc as per number of
            cameras connected.
            <br><br>
            From line 10-19 we are running a loop to read the frames coming from camera and
            showing it to a window created
            by OpenCV. So in the loop in line 12 we take ret, frame after reading the input from
            the cam
            as cam.read(), where ret is the status of the captured frame and frame is
            the image.
            <br><br>
            In line 15, we are showing our captured image in frame variable in a window named
            "Webcam" using the opencv function cv2.imshow()
            <br><br>
            In line 18-19, we are creating a condition that when a user presses the q button on
            keybord
            the loop breaks and executes the upcoming lines
            <br><br>

            In line 22 and 24, we just close the opened camera and also close all the windows
            created by opencv during the
            execution of program.
        </p>


        <span class="d-block fs-3" style="font-weight: 100;">Reading Video from a file</span>
        <p style="font-weight: 100;">
            Reading a video from a file is not a much different task as what we have to
            do is to change the source of feed
            provided, that is, in the previous section our source of input was camera
            and hence we were giving argument as
            a number <strong>0</strong> to access the default camera and now to access
            a file on the system as feed we
            will provide the path of the file as argument to the function.<br>
            Here is the code, check it out. And just to remind after this we have a
            <strong>bonus</strong>.<br>

        <span class="d-block fs-3" style="font-weight: 100;">Bonus</span>
        <p style="font-weight: 100;">
            So as stated above i am going to show you how you can read mutiple
            cameras simulatneously and I know after
            reading this much of blog you would be having a idea how to do it. But
            to make you comfortable with it I
            am just going to provide the code here and I promise there is nothing
            new to explain here, infact you
            will explain what is happening to yourself (Its a great excercise
            !!).<br><br>
            And Thanks for your love and support by reading this blog !!<br>
